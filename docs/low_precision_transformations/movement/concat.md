## Introduction
`ConcatTransformation` transformation decompose `FakeQuantize` operations and move dequantization operations through `Concat` operation. As result `Concat` operations are inferred in low precision and propagate low precision to the next operations. The difference from `ConcatMultiChannelsTransformation` is per-tensor quantization support only.

## Intermediate operations before Concat
`MaxPool` and `Interpolate` are intermediate operations before `Concat`.

## Intermediate operations before Concat with output
`MaxPool` is intermediate operation before `Concat`.

## Several Concat operations with one common FakeQuantize (not cascading)
Several `Concat` operations have on common `FakeQuantize`. Note, please, `Concat` operations are not cascading.
